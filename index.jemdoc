== About me
I am a doctoral candidate in [https://amsc.umd.edu/ Applied Mathematics & Statistics, and Scientific Computation (AMSC) Program] at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
I am fortunately advised by Prof. [https://haizhaoyang.github.io/ Haizhao Yang].


My research interests encompass computational mathematics, machine learning, numerical linear algebra, and their practical applications in various scientific fields.

Before joining UMD, I graduated from [https://www.utexas.edu/ University of Texas at Austin] with a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences.


== Research
My research interests include 
- Scientific Machine Learning (Foundation Model, Reinforcement Learning)
- High Performance Computing
- Mathematical Data Science
- Dynamical Systems
- Numerical Linear Algebra
